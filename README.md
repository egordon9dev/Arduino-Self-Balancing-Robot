# Arduino-Self-Balancing-Robot
This is code for a two wheeled self balancing robot (inverted pendulum) robot. It uses Bluetooth for communication. The code uses PID feedback loops to set the robots velocity and pitch angle. A low-pass filter is also used to help prevent sudden set-point changes of the angle PID.
